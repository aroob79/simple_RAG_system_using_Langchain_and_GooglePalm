Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the United States surpassed the British Empire\\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11] Among others, India has also experienced an economic boom since the implementation of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s.[12]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\nTable\\n\\nThe table initially ranks each IMF member including \\xa0sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign states and territories, and countries with limited

A\\xa0higher GDP indicates that the country is financially strong and growing at a stable rate.\\xa0According to the World GDP Ranking 2024 list, India is the fifth largest economy in the world. Other prominent countries like the United States of America, China, Japan, Germany, etc., have a significant presence in this GDP Ranking list.\\n\\nEach country has their own unique characteristics and regional strengths that contribute to its overall economic growth. To find more information about India’s contribution towards its economy, read on.\\n\\nTop 10 GDP Countries 2024:\\n\\nWith a GDP of more than 20 trillion dollars, the United States of America is the world’s largest economy. Since China continues to invest heavily in economic growth, China has come close to becoming the largest economy. Other notable nations like Germany, India, and the United Kingdom follow next.\\xa0To know the top 10 GDP countries, look at the list below:\\n\\nS. No. Country Name Continent GDP (USD Billion)* 1 United States America 28,783 2 China Asia 18,536 3 Germany Europe 4,730 4 Japan Asia 4,112 5 India Asia 3,942 6 United Kingdom Europe 3,502 7 France Europe 3,132 8 Brazil America 2,333 9 Italy Europe 2,332 10 Canada America 2,242\\n\\nThis data is as of 30 April 2024\\n\\nIndia GDP 2024 Rank\\n\\nWith strong macroeconomic fundamentals, robust domestic demand, fiscal discipline, high saving rates and demographic trends,\\xa0India is now the fifth-largest economy in the world. Today, India’s leading economic contributors are traditional and modern agriculture, technology services, the handicraft industry, and business outsourcing.\\n\\nWith an estimated GDP of more than Rs.173.82 lakh crore generated by a population of over 1 billion, India is among the highest population-based economies in the world.\\n\\nAdditionally, as per the recent data, India will tend to grow 8.2% in 2023-24.\\xa0This means India's economic growth next fiscal year will be the fastest among major economies. Therefore, in the upcoming years, rising consumption and investments, both domestic and foreign, will contribute to the nation’s growth and may also help India to rank higher in the World GDP Ranking list.\\n\\nIndia GDP Per Capita 2024 / India Per Capita Income 2024\\n\\nKnowing India's rank in the World GDP Ranking 2024 list, it is evident that the value of output per person is quite substantial. India's per capita income of the population for 2024 is 2.85%. As per the Union government, the rise in the per capita income of people has pushed many households into higher income brackets.\\n\\nIn the financial year 2023, India's per capita income is nearly 2 lakh.\\xa0 On the contrary, in the financial year 2012, India’s per capita income was 71,609. It has increased by 175% in the last 10 years. The drastic increase in population and demand for employment has significantly increased the nation's GDP per capita.\\n\\nIndia's GDP Growth Rate - Last 10 Years\\n\\nThe calculation of GDP involves calculating the value of goods and services produced for market sale and non-market production, such as government-provided education or defence services. GDP is significantly important as the size of an economy is measured by the total production of goods and services in the economy.\\n\\nIn this regard, India's economy is expected to rise in the upcoming years. With 8.2% growth, India will be one of the fastest-growing trillion-dollar economies in the world in 2024. To keep an eye on India's GDP growth rate, here is the complete list of the GDP growth rate over the last 10 years:\\n\\nYear GDP Growth (%) Annual Change 2013 6.39% 0.93% 2014 7.41% 1.02% 2015 8.00% 0.59% 2016 8.26% 0.26% 2017 6.80% -1.46% 2018 6.45% -0.34% 2019 3.74% -2.72% 2020 -6.60% -10.33% 2021 8.68% 15.28% 2022 7% 1.68% 2023 8.2% 1% -0.2%\\n\\nFrom the above table it is evident that after recovering from a negative economic growth rate during the pandemic, the country now has a good GDP growth rate of 8.2%. Despite its lower GDP per capita, India continues to climb up the list. Different sectors, including agriculture, business and others, contribute the most to employment in every term, making it one of the largest growing economies.\\n\\nCalculating GDP\\n\\nGDP is calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nY = C + I + G + (X − M)\\n\\nC represents consumption, which includes spending on services, non-durable goods, and durable goods.\\n\\nI represents investment, which consists of spending on housing and equipment.\\n\\nG represents government expenditure, which includes salaries of employees, construction of roads, railways, airports, schools, and military expenses.\\n\\nThe difference between total exports and imports is referred to as net exports, denoted by (X-M).\\n\\nIn this context, Y represents the Gross Domestic Product.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOver time, the size of India's economy has increased, and therefore it has bagged fifth position in the\\xa0World GDP Ranking 2024 list. Today, different government initiatives have ensured that all citizens lead a better quality of life, improving our position in the world ranking list.\\n\\nCan't get yourself started on taxes?\\n\\nGet a Cleartax expert to handle all your tax filing start-to-finish\\n\\nGet Cleartax expertise now\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nWhat is GDP per capita rank?\\n\\nGDP per capita is calculated by dividing the country's GDP by its population.

The agricultural and industrial sectors slowed, with the latter weighed on by weaker manufacturing momentum. More positively, construction and services output expanded more strongly, while growth was also faster in the education, financial, ICT, real estate, public and arts and recreation sectors.
